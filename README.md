### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you are a student of mine and you are looking for your class repository, you can go [here](https://github.com/johnfraserss).  Find your class, then go to the Wiki for it.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on rebuilding my website using a flat file CMS instead of all the heavy CMS options out there.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) for fun.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't use social media. See a username that is the same as this one? It isn't me.
